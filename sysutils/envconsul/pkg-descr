envconsul provides a convenient way to populate values from Consul into an
child process environment using the envconsul daemon.

The daemon envconsul allows applications to be configured with environmental
variables, without having knowledge about the existence of Consul. This makes
it especially easy to configure applications throughout all your environments:
development, testing, production, etc.

envconsul is inspired by envdir in its simplicity, name, and function.
